# python-design-pattern-examples

This particular repo will have most of the design patterns in python 

## <ins>Design Patterns</ins>
Design patterns are general concept for solving a particular problem., it is a principle for the OOP.
The Pattern is not a specific piece of code to solve the problem it is a long term analysis.
The code of the same pattern can be used in two or more different programs may be different.


Remeber Design patterns and algorithms are not same.

### Classification OF Design Patterns

1. Creational Patterns- provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    - Factory method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singletone

2. Structural Patterns- explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

3. Behavioural patterns-  take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
        *  is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
    - Template Method
    - Visitor


### What Really the DP's(Design Patterns) consists of?

DP's are used for manageble scalable and reusable to design or develop a software 
Somethings are require understand DP's in many ways

+ Intent
+ Motivation
+ Structure
+ Code Example
